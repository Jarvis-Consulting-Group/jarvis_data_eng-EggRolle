# Nophil Mehboob . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent York University graduate, obtaining my honours bachelor in computer science and am currently employed by Jarvis Technical Consulting as a data engineer. During my time at York I was able to focus on courses and projects largely involved with machine learning/data mining principles during my last year of study and working with relational database systems. Most of my experience and learning exists in the form of my projects all of which I find I'm very passionate about and have enjoyed developing. What I really like about software development and programming is the opportunity to work on projects which are real and tangible, making whatever effort I put in feel meaningful. Its this principle that drives me to continue learning as much as I can to keep developing projects I enjoy working on.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-EggRolle](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-EggRolle)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-EggRolle/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented a Linux application responsible for recording hardware specifications and usage information of a series of multiple servers connected internally through a switch and which communicate through IPv4 addresses. The program utilizes a monitoring agent which regularly runs bash scripts responsible for querying all of the relevant information from the system, and then inserting it into a Postgres SQL database hosted using a Docker instance. The agent is regulated using a Crontab instance which ensures the hardware information is queried and recorded at regular time intervals.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-EggRolle/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - Grep App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.

## Highlighted Projects
**Data Mining Capstone Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/EggRolle/Trending-Youtube-Analysis)]: Examined a dataset pulled from Kaggle providing thousands of data points containing information on trending Youtube videos across the span of a year. Following this I preformed many Data Mining/Machine Learning fundamentals, such as Association Rule Mining, Principle Component Analysis, Classification and K-means Clustering to identify patterns within the data.

**Wallify - Spotify Wallpaper Tool** [[GitHub](https://github.com/EggRolle/Wallify)]: Developed a Python application which accesses Spotify's API using a user login which provides JSON objects containing various information on the user's currently playing song. The link to the song's album's cover image is extracted and then adjusted to be stylishly presented as the user's desktop wallpaper. It functions by using several core Python libraries such as requests/oauth2 to access and obtain data from the Spotify API, and the Pillow package to manipulate the image which is used as a desktop wallpaper.


## Professional Experiences
