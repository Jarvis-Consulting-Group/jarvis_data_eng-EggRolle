# Nophil Mehboob . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent York University graduate, obtaining my honors bachelor in computer science and am currently employed by Jarvis Technical Consulting as a data engineer. During my time at York, I focused on exploring courses and projects largely involving machine learning, data mining principles and working with relational database systems. I am very passionate about developing and enjoy applying myself through the many projects I have worked on in the past, using every project I tackle as a learning experience to grow my knowledge and imporve my programming skills. What I like about software development and programming is having the opportunity to work on projects where I can really see my work and effort come to life. Being able to ship out code or an application which I know is having an impact is the principle that drives me to continue learning as much as I can in an effort to keep developing projects I enjoy working on.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-EggRolle](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-EggRolle)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-EggRolle/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented a Linux application responsible for recording hardware specifications and usage information of a series of multiple servers connected internally through a switch which communicate to eachother. The program utilizes a monitoring agent which regularly runs bash scripts responsible for querying all of the relevant information from the system, and then inserting it into a Postgres SQL database hosted using a Docker instance. The agent is regulated using a Crontab instance which ensures the hardware information is queried and recorded at regular time intervals.


## Highlighted Projects
**Data Mining Capstone Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/EggRolle/Trending-Youtube-Analysis)]: Examined a dataset pulled from Kaggle providing thousands of data points containing information on trending Youtube videos across the span of a year. Following this, I performed many Data Mining/Machine Learning algorithms and concepts such as Association Rule Mining, Principle Component Analysis, Classification and K-means Clustering to identify patterns within the data.

**Wallify - Spotify Wallpaper Tool** [[GitHub](https://github.com/EggRolle/Wallify)]: Developed a Python application that accesses Spotify's API using a user login which provides JSON objects containing various information on the user's currently playing song. The link to the song's album's cover image is extracted and then adjusted to be stylishly presented as the user's desktop wallpaper. It functions by using several core Python libraries such as requests/oauth2 to access and obtain data from the Spotify API, and the Pillow package to manipulate the image which is used as a desktop wallpaper.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2023-present)**: Gained valuable experience working on various software development projects in a professional work setting employing an Agile work environment employing regular scum meetings.

**Tutor, Kumon (2015-2020)**: Worked with a wide variety of students on a weekly basis, setting learning goals and tracking improvements. The position provided me an opportunity to practice and demonstrate my strong communication skills through regularly interacting with students during tutoring sessions and when conveying the student's performance in the program with their parents.
